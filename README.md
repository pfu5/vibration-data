# vibration-data

This program reads from csv files (which are too large to upload here), converts data type, sorts values, and perform fft on data sets. The results were used to plot raw data graphs as well as fft data graphs.

The information from the graphs were referenced as test parameter values for a fretting corrosion analysis project.
